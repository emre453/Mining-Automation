Project: Mining Automation Requirements Analysis
1. Introduction

This analysis aims to identify the requirements for an automation system within an online game where a character travels to a mining area, breaks stones automatically, deposits valuable items into a bank, sells trash items, and repeats the process. This system is intended to save the player time and improve efficiency in performing specific in-game tasks.

2. Objective

Enable the character to automatically travel to the mining area and perform the stone-breaking function.
Automate the process of depositing valuable items into the bank and selling trash items.
Repeat the cycle of these tasks continuously.
3. Requirement Categories

3.1. Functional Requirements

Stone Breaking

The character should automatically break stones in the mining area at specified intervals.
Each stone-breaking action should be repeated within a set duration or at set intervals.
Item Management

Valuable items should be identified, and the character should collect these items.
Valuable items should be stored in the bank as they accumulate in the inventory.
Trash items should be sold automatically.
Item Transfer to Bank

Valuable items should be automatically transferred to the bank when the banking process is initiated.
The process can be paused when the bank is full or reaches a certain threshold.
Sales Functionality

Trash items should be automatically sold when the characterâ€™s inventory reaches a certain level.
Sales should be conducted for specified items.
Loop Functionality

Stone breaking, item transfer to the bank, and sales should repeat in a continuous loop.
3.2. Performance Requirements

Tasks should be performed with minimal delay, especially optimizing the stone-breaking interval.
Each task within the loop should be completed sequentially with minimal waiting time.
3.3. Security Requirements

Random delays and variations should be incorporated to avoid detection by the game.
The automation should be compatible with third-party software, considering account security and privacy.
3.4. Usability Requirements

A user-friendly interface should allow easy control over mining area selection, stone breaking, and item management tasks.
Notifications should be sent to the user while tasks are running in the background.
4. Technical Requirements

HDR Unpacker: An HDR unpacker is required to remove specific in-game objects for more accurate object detection.
Driver Implementation: A custom driver should be created using the Interception Driver instead of win32 API to handle inputs and interactions more reliably.
Programming Language: Python or a C-based language is preferred for stability and ease of use.
Required Libraries: Libraries such as PyAutoGUI or OpenCV for image recognition, in addition to the Interception Driver, for input handling.
Platform: Should be run in a virtual machine or a reliable computer environment.
5. Assumptions and Constraints

The automation will work only within the specified game environment.
In-game changes (e.g., changes to stone locations or mining area layout) may affect the automation, requiring adjustments.
6. Additional Requirements

Analytics: The effectiveness of the automation, success rate, and item collection performance should be analyzed.
